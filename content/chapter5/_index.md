The cabling infrastructure is based mainly on CAT6 cables to provide a reliable connection between the main switch and the access points. 

In some cases, CAT5 cables were used to provide connectivity to endpoints where not many users were expected to be connected. 

There is no patch panel as the switch is located close to the router and the cables that leave from the switch are directly connected to the access points.

The RJ45 were created on site depending on the lenght the cable had to cover. Straight through cables were made following the T-568B wiring scheme as depicted below.

## Cable Labeling Scheme

Cables were labelled using post it flags with the name of the endpoint which can be either an Access Point, a PTP Antenna, a router or any device at the other end of the cable.

En example of cable labelling is depicted below.
