This chapter will detail the devices used to build the SPV's LAN network.

Currently the network is built using devices from the ISP Starlink which corresponde to the satelitte antenna and the modem/router.

Because there is a potential grow of users in time, an additional router was added to serve as the main router to handle the traffic and provide a better performance.

A secondary main switch was added to provide a better performance and to handle the traffic between the router and the access points.

Several small switches are scattered through the modules to be able to extend the network and provide coverage to the facilities such as EPC Office Module, the warehouse, the lower meeting room and the living quarters.

This section will describe every device used to build the SPV's LAN network in detail with their techincal specifications.

Configurations will be described in chapter 6.
