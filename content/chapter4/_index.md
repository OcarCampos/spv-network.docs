This chapter will detail the IP Addressing Scheme of the network at the SPV's LAN network.

## IP Addressing Scheme

The IP Addressing Scheme of the network at the SPV's LAN network is as follows:

- ISP Modem: 192.168.1.1
- Main Router: 192.168.2.1
- Switches: 192.168.2.2 - 192.168.2.5
- Access Points: 192.168.2.6 - 192.168.2.20
- Air Links: 192.168.2.21 - 192.168.2.30
- Static IP Devices: 192.168.2.31 - 192.168.2.100
- Dynamic IP Devices: 192.168.2.101 - 192.168.2.254
