The used topology to build the SPV's LAN network is a tree topology. 

The starting point is the USG-PRO-4 router which is connected to the Starlink Modem. 

From the USG-PRO-4 router, the network is extended to the ES-24-Lite switch which then distributes the network to the different devices in the network.

The network distributes the data mainly over wifi using Ubiquity Access Points model UAC-AP-LR. 

The Access Points are connected to the ES-24-Lite switch directly. 

In some cases air links were created using NANO Loco M5 Antennaes and LiteBeam M5 antennas to extend the network ending up with UAC-AP-LR access points that provide WiFi to client devices. 

The network that correspond to the living quarters is outside the Ubiquity standard and must be built using a different approach as it is for leisure rather than for work.
